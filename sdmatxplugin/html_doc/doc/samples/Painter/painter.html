    Painter Sample
   </h1>
   <p>
    The MaterialX Substance Designer plugin can generate Substance painter 
compatible GLSL files. It's somewhat limited and make sure to check the
Standard Surface implementation notes in the what is supported in the
    <a href="../../standard_surface_compatibility.html">
     standard surface compatibility
    </a>
    part of the documentation.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Painter Template
   </h2>
   <p>
    There is a template file for making painter shaders compatible with standard
surface in the directory
    <code>
     sdmatxplugin/data/samples/PainterTemplate.sbs
    </code>
    . It's
meant to support the standard maps of a PBR metallic roughness project.
   </p>
   <p>
    Load the shader in Substance Designer
   </p>
   <h3>
    Features of the shader
   </h3>
   <p>
    The shader is mainly constructed using a set of color and float inputs directly
wired to a standard surface. This makes sense for a template it's setting up
for adding effects to a shader. The main thing to notice are that some of the
inputs are set up with
    <strong>
     Sampler Usage
    </strong>
    and some are not. The ones with a
    <strong>
     Sampler Usage
    </strong>
    will be mapped to textures and the ones without to constants.
The sampler usage is available when selecting an exposed input. The openGL
parameter sets whether the tangent space for the normal map is OpenGL or DirectX.
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="images/sampler-usage.png" title="Sampler Usage"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    That image has the baseColor Sampler Usage meaning it will use the base color 
channel in painter. A full list of supported usages can be found in the 
Usage Mappings section in
    <a href="../../../README.html">
     README.md
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    The exposed maps will be sampled using the corresponding channel in the painter
project:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     basecolor
    </li>
    <li>
     roughness
    </li>
    <li>
     metalness
    </li>
    <li>
     emission_color
    </li>
    <li>
     normal_map
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The exposed constants will be possible to tweak on the shader:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     base (multiplier for the base color)
    </li>
    <li>
     specular (multiplier for the specular effect)
    </li>
    <li>
     specular_color (color multiplier for the specular highlight on non-metallic 
parts)
    </li>
    <li>
     specular_IOR (IOR for non-metallic parts)
    </li>
    <li>
     emission (multiplier for the emission color)
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h4>
    The Normal map
   </h4>
   <p>
    The normal map is sampled from an exposed
    <strong>
     texture_2d
    </strong>
    node as opposed to a color constructor. It's an alternate
way of accessing textures allowing you to select the uv to sample with. 
In this case we are not using that feature specific feature but we are 
trying to avoid the iRay default behavior in designer
to convert colors with the
    <strong>
     normal
    </strong>
    usage to world space automatically which
would make it incompatible with painter and the GL viewport in Substance Designer.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Using the shader
   </h3>
   <p>
    In order to use the shader, press the
    <strong>
     Export Painter
    </strong>
    Button in the UI
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="images/gui-button.png" title="Export Painter button"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    This will write out a file in named after the MaterialX Graph, in this case 
PainterTemplate, in the painter sub directory in the plugin document directory.
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="images/painter-export-location.png" title="Export Location"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to use the file
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Start Substance Painter and load a project using PBR Metallic Roughness Maps
    </li>
    <li>
     Drag the exported GLSL file to the shelf and import it to the project
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="images/import-dialog.png" title="Import Dialog"/>
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Set the project to use the shader by opening the
     <strong>
      Shader Settings
     </strong>
     and select
the imported PainterTemplate
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="images/select-shader.png" title="Select Shader"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    If everything went right the shader appears similar to the default Painter 
PBR Shader. This means that the painted maps are properly passed through to
the shader and used as inputs to it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The exposed parameters are available in the Shader Settings and can be tweaked
for the object globally.
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="images/shader-settings.png" title="Shader Settings"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    This shader doesn't do much interesting, it is a template to get started
from.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Detail Map Shader
   </h2>
   <p>
    In this sample file we are actually making use of the MaterialX graph to add a 
detail map to the shader.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Detail maps
   </h3>
   <p>
    A detail map is a texture blended with the base textures in order to apply
additional high frequency details to hide lack of resolution in the base texture.
It typically implemented as a tiled monochrome texture with some type of noise. 
Given its main contribution is seen when zooming in, the tiling is less likely
to be seen.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Procedural Shaders
   </h3>
   <p>
    In this detail map shader you can either source your details from the a texture
or a procedural fractal. The procedural fractal is computed in the shader
program rather than by looking at a texture. This gives the benefit of it not
being limited by the resolution of a texture and it can also avoid a lot of the
tiling issues compared to a texture. One of the issues with procedural shaders
is they don't necessarily deal with minification as well as ordinary textures
meaning they can appear noisy when seen at a distance.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Overview of the shader
   </h2>
   <p>
    The structure of the shader is shared with the Painter Template so
most of the basic features are set up the same way.
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="images/detail-shader.png" title="Detail map shader"/>
   </p>
   <h3>
    Detail Map Inputs
   </h3>
   <p>
    The detail map input section contains the exposed parameters for the detail
map. It contains:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A texture input for a detail map
    </li>
    <li>
     A texture input for a detail normal map
    </li>
    <li>
     A scaling for the UV set
    </li>
    <li>
     Blend factors for controlling to what extent it affects different
shader features.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      texture_procedural_ratio
     </strong>
     to control to what extent the shader
    </li>
    <li>
     should use the detail texture or procedural map.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    A value of 0 means all texture and 1 all procedural noise.
Note that the normal is always taken from the detail normal image and
there won't be any normal influence from the procedural details. It's
messy to extract normals from textures and procedural way in a fully
predictable way so the normal is a separate texture to avoid this.
   </p>
   <p>
    The odd inputs are the texture_2d inputs called detail and detail_normal. 
They have
    <strong>
     detail
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     detail_normal
    </strong>
    respectively 
as sampler usage. These usages are not known by Substance Painter
meaning it will not use any data from the texture sets but show up as an
input on the shader itself. This is exactly the behavior we want since
the very point of it is to tile it over the model rather than using unique
texturing which is the case for known usages. Also note that the textures
are sampled using an image node. This allows us to use our own UV's. In this 
case we use UV's with a scale applied.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Detail Map Scaling
   </h3>
   <p>
    This section controls how the UV's and position is scaled when applying
details from textures and procedurals.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Detail Map Procedural Blending
   </h3>
   <p>
    This section we mix the detail texture and detail procedural.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Detail Map Blending
   </h3>
   <p>
    The detail map blends the base texture with the detail map, this is done 
individually for the affected texture to give more control over the effect. 
In this case the
formula is
    <strong>
     base * (detail * intensity + (1.0 - intensity))
    </strong>
    .
This means that when detail is 1 it will return the base multiplied with 
the monochrome detail map and when it's 0 it will return the base without
any details applied. Anything in-between will be a blend between those to
values. An effect of this blending is applying details will always darken the
original textures. This is often not the desired behavior since
it might make the object look darker at a distance when the details are
less visible. Note that often 1.0 is too strong of an effect and
it's typically better to use a lower value to make the effect more subtle.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Using the Shader
   </h2>
   <p>
    To test out the shader in designer, load the file
    <code>
     data/samples/Painter/PainterTemplate.sbs
    </code>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Make sure to bind the textures from the graph and make it current in the 
viewport and you should see a yellow box with some tiling variation. 
This is a good time to play with parameters to get different looks for the
details.
   </p>
   <p>
    When done experimenting in Designer you can export it to Painter using the
    <strong>
     Export Painter
    </strong>
    button. Like in the previous example it will be located 
in the painter sub directory in the plugin document directory.
   </p>
   <p>
    Start Painter. In the images below we use the JadeToad asset bundled with
painter. When you have loaded a project, import the shader to the project 
shelf. You can now assign it in the
    <strong>
     Shader Settings
    </strong>
    tab. By default
you will se a little bit of noise on the model coming from the procedural.
   </p>
   <p>
    Open up the
    <strong>
     Shader Settings
    </strong>
    and now you can see the inputs for the detail
map show up.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here we can control the different parameters of the detail map.
The first thing to note is that the detail texture input is now showing up
as a shader input. You can bring in your own images or select something from
the shelf and plug in there. Note, shader texture input slots only work with
images and not general procedurals from the shelf. This is a limitation in
Painter. If you are not sure of how to correctly connect things, make sure
you import an image as a texture to your shelf for your detail map and detail
normals.
   </p>
   <p>
    When tweaking the details themselves, it's often a good idea to pull the 
detail_color all the way to 1, this will give the strongest effect. From there
you can start tweaking scaling, ratio between the procedural and texture noise
etc. When that looks good, you can tone down the color effect and change 
how it interacts with the other texture channels which tend to be more subtle
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="images/with-without.png" title="Toad with and without detail maps"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    This image shows the detail map disabled on the left and enabled on the right
It's a subtle effect but there it's useful to cover up lack of texture
and make the object more interesting.

    Substance MaterialX plugin beta
   </h1>
   <p>
    MaterialX plugin for Substance Designer
   </p>
   <h2>
    Overview
   </h2>
   <p>
    The Substance Designer MaterialX plugin allows creating MaterialX graphs from Substance
Designer.
This is an experimental plugin and it doesn't intend to support everything and
takes certain short cuts. This means you should be cautious using it in a production 
setting at this point.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Features
   </h3>
   <p>
    The plugin allows you to build MaterialX Graphs and export them.

   <h2>
    Installation
   </h2>
   <p>
    To install the plugin, copy the plugin directory to the
    <code>
     sduserplugins
    </code>
    directory. It's
typically located in
    <code>
     c:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\Documents\Allegorithmic\Substance Designer\python\sduserplugins
    </code>
    You can also place it in a custom location and add that directory to the python plugin paths. 
If you have an old version of the plugin installed, remove it before starting to avoid any old files causing
issues. The only thing you might want to preserve is data/config/sdmatxplugin-config.json if you have edited it.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order for the plugin to work the directory it's installed in needs
to be writable from Substance designer
   </p>
   <p>
    After installing the plugin you'll need to install the Python 3.7 version 
of MaterialX 1.37.2. Prebuilt packages for Windows
can be found from the
    <a href="https://github.com/materialx/MaterialX/releases/download/v1.37.2/MaterialX_Windows_VS2017_x64_Python37.zip">
     MaterialX Github
    </a>
    . 
Note that we strive to always support the latest master build but in 
general it's safer to use the specific link above to make sure no 
recently introduced change break things.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can either put it at a location of your choice
and point the environment variable
    <code>
     MATERIALX_ROOT
    </code>
    to it or put the content of the
package in the directory
    <code>
     MaterialX
    </code>
    in the materialx designer plugin directory.
    <a href="doc/build_cmake.html">
     If working on Linux/Mac you need to build your own MaterialX package
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    When the plugin is installed with MaterialX, open Substance Designer and
make sure the plugin location is set as a python plug-in directory. Note, 
the plugin directory should be a descendant of the plugin directory you add as opposed to
adding the directory with the plugin directly.
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="doc/images/python_plugin_path.png" title="Designer preferences"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    After changing the path, restart Designer for the update
to be acknowledged.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the plugin is properly installed the directory layout should look like this (contents of deeper directories 
cropped out):
    <code>
     sdmatxplugin
    ├── MaterialX
    │   ├── bin
    │   ├── cmake
    │   ├── include
    │   ├── lib
    │   ├── libraries
    │   ├── python
    │   └── resources
    ├── data
    ├── doc
    └── python
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>
    In case of a successful plugin installation a new toolbar button will show
up looking like this:

   <h2>
    Getting Started
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Creating a graph
   </h3>
   <p>
    Create a MaterialX Graph using the toolbar button
This will put you in a special version of the MDL editor where all the
nodes are from MaterialX standard library with the exception of some helper
nodes we'll explain below.
   </p>
   <h4>
    The basics
   </h4>
   <p>
    The first node you want to adding an ubershader. The main supported
one today is standard surface. Press tab, search for
    <em>
     standard_surface
    </em>
    , create
it and then set it as root by right clicking on it and selecting that option 
from the menu. The standard surface material model is extensive, the implementation
in the Substance Designer plugin is somewhat limited, the details are here,
    <a href="doc/standard_surface_compatibility.html">
     Standard Surface Limitations
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, make sure your viewport is set to
    <strong>
     iRay
    </strong>
    .
Right click on the graph in the designer explorer or in the back of the 
graph editor and select
    <strong>
     Set as Material Definition in 3D View
    </strong>
    .
If everything is working you should have a plain white object in the viewport
   </p>
   <p>
    You can tweak the parameters but to see something more exciting you can 
create a noise node called
    <em>
     noise_3d_color3
    </em>
    and connect it to the base 
color. This will now show you a procedurally generated pattern on your node
   </p>
   <p>
    From here you can experiment with nodes. Everything available in the graph
are MaterialX Nodes.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Exposing parameters
   </h4>
   <p>
    Exposing parameters works like in the ordinary mdl editor. You create a 
constant and select exposed on it.
This means they can be tweaked externally and will end up in the public 
interface if the material you are working on.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Tweaking parameters
   </h4>
   <p>
    In order to get a consistent behavior between the iRay and GL viewport the
recommended place to tweak parameters is from the MaterialX graph properties.
Double click in the background of the graph editor or select the graph in the 
explorer to get to it.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Textures
   </h4>
   <p>
    To bind textures to a graph in a way that is compatible with both GL and iRay,
Expose a usage with the
    <em>
     Sampler Usage
    </em>
    set on it. Note that other ways of binding
textures such as referencing resources and directly introducing comp graphs into
the MaterialX graph are
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    supported and may give undefined behavior at this point.
   </p>
   <p>
    If creating a color constant, expose it 
and set its
    <em>
     Sampler Usage
    </em>
    as baseColor it will be exposed as a texture input 
rather than a color.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to bind a texture to it in designer, create a comp graph with a 
baseColor output right click on it and select
    <em>
     View Outputs in 3d view
    </em>
    or 
drag it to the viewport you are working in. Note that in the case of an 
exposed color the UV used is always UV 0 which is often what you want.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another thing to note here is if binding textures from an sbsar file (as opposed)
to an sbs file you need to import it into a compositing graph and connect the outputs to
the outputs. It's unfortunately not possible to render the textures directly from the
sbsar file in Designer.
   </p>
   <p>
    In case you want to take control of the UV generation yourself, create a
    <em>
     texture_2d
    </em>
    node and expose it instead. In order to sample from it you can
use the
    <em>
     image
    </em>
    family of nodes. They have a UV input so you can tile or 
select different sources of UV's.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Notes on texturing
   </h4>
   <p>
    In general you want to sample color textures using
    <em>
     sRGB
    </em>
    as
    <em>
     Gamma Type
    </em>
    and
all other textures as
    <em>
     Gamma Linear
    </em>
    . For the GL Viewport gamma type is only active
on Color textures. For vector and float types they will always be considered linear
regardless of what the setting says.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Normal maps
   </h4>
   <p>
    There is a default behavior for converting directly exposed
    <em>
     float3
    </em>
    as 
normal maps to world space which is inconsistent between the GLSL viewport and
the iRay viewport.
   </p>
   <p>
    For normal maps, please use
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Explicit sampling using a
     <em>
      texture_2d
     </em>
    </li>
    <li>
     Use
     <em>
      image_vector3
     </em>
     for getting the value
    </li>
    <li>
     Use
     <em>
      Gamma Linear
     </em>
    </li>
    <li>
     Use the node
     <em>
      algnormalTStoWS
     </em>
     to do an explicit tangent space to world space
conversion before feeding it into the normal input of the shader.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>
    The GL viewport
   </h3>
   <p>
    The MaterialX plugin can visualize shaders in the GL viewport in addition
to the iRay one. In order to set it up, start by switching to the GL viewport.
   </p>
   <p>
    When using the
    <em>
     standard_surface
    </em>
    shader it will generate a glslfx file in
    <code>
     &lt;pluginroot&gt;/data/shaders/standard_surface_generated.glslfx
    </code>
    which is 
incrementally exported as you edit your shader.
   </p>
   <p>
    Load this file (unfortunately there is not a script api call for doing
this meaning you'll have to do it manually for now). If it succeeds it should
show the shader, potentially with incorrect textures. Drag the comp graph 
you want to bind textures from into the viewport and you should have OpenGL
preview of your shader.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Debug mode
   </h4>
   <p>
    When using the OpenGL viewport there is a debug mode allowing you to 
visualize the currently selected node instead of the root node. It's available
in the MaterialX editor toolbar (note, this doesn't work when using iRay).
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="alt text" src="doc/images/selection_preview.png" title="Selection Preview"/>
   </p>
   <h4>
    Swizzling
   </h4>
   <p>
    Swizzle patterns are described as a string and supports rgba/xyzw. To 
duplicate
    <em>
     x
    </em>
    3 times in a 3 vector, input the string
    <em>
     xxx
    </em>
   </p>
   <h4>
    Types
   </h4>
   <p>
    Types map generally between MDL and MaterialX but there are some 
differences
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Vector types in MDL (float2, float3, float4) are called vector2, vector3, 
vector4 in designer. When creating a constant of float3 it maps directly to a
a MaterialX vector3 etc.
    </li>
    <li>
     The MDL color type maps to color3 in MaterialX
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Currently there has been no ambition to try to map all MDL types accurately to 
MaterialX but only support what is needed to get the
standard library working
   </p>
   <h3>
    Painter Export
   </h3>
   <p>
    When pressing the
    <em>
     Export Painter
    </em>
    button a glsl file compatible with Painter
in generated the
    <userdocs>
     /Allegorithmic/Substance Designer/sdmatx/painter
Note that usages known in painter will be exported as paintable channels
all other inputs with usages will be considered textures on shader level. This means you
should not do anything to the UV's on texture inputs that are paintable or things 
will behave very strangely in Painter. Currently the only supported ubershader for painter
is standard surface. It's also a very limited implementation. An additional issue 
is there are some
short cuts in how the texture sets are being sampled causing occasional flicker in
the viewport.
    </userdocs>
   </p>
   <h4>
    Usage mappings
   </h4>
   <p>
    The known usages in designer that are mapped to the appropriate texture sets are:
    <code>
     _usage_mapping = {
    'ambientOcclusion': 'channel_ambientocclusion',
    'anisotropyAngle': 'channel_anisotropyangle',
    'anisotropyLevel': 'channel_anisotropylevel',
    'baseColor': 'channel_basecolor',
    'blendingmask': 'channel_blendingmask',
    'diffuse': 'channel_diffuse',
    'displacement': 'channel_displacement',
    'emissive': 'channel_emissive',
    'glossiness': 'channel_glossiness',
    'height': 'channel_height',
    'IOR': 'channel_ior',
    'metallic': 'channel_metallic',
    'normal': 'channel_normal',
    'opacity': 'channel_opacity',
    'reflection': 'channel_reflection',
    'roughness': 'channel_roughness',
    'scattering': 'channel_scattering',
    'specular': 'channel_specular',
    'specularLevel': 'channel_specularLevel',
    'transmissive': 'channel_transmissive',
    'user0': 'channel_user0',
    'user1': 'channel_user1',
    'user2': 'channel_user2',
    'user3': 'channel_user3',
    'user4': 'channel_user4',
    'user5': 'channel_user5',
    'user6': 'channel_user6',
    'user7': 'channel_user7',
    'texture_ambientocclusion' : 'texture_ambientocclusion',
    'texture_curvature':'texture_curvature',
    'texture_id':'texture_id',
    'texture_normal':'texture_normal',
    'texture_normal_ws':'texture_normal_ws',
    'texture_position':'texture_position',
    'texture_thickness':'texture_thickness'
}
    </code>
    The usages prefixed texture_ are referring to baked mesh maps.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to use the shader in painter, import the generated glsl file to your project
and set it as the active shader in the project.
   </p>
   <h3>
    MaterialX Export
   </h3>
   <p>
    Exports the graph as a MaterialX, optionally with all dependencies and resources.
   </p>
   <h3>
    MaterialX View
   </h3>
   <p>
    Opens up MaterialXView with the current Graph. Note, you need to explicitly select what
graph to export textures from.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Subgraphs
   </h3>
   <p>
    Subgraphs is an experimental feature.
   </p>
   <p>
    It allows creating functions to be used in other graphs. All subgraphs are namespaced
based on the substance file it's located in so multiple graphs in the same document can be
exported together.
   </p>
   <p>
    To create a subgraph:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Create a new Substance Document with an MaterialX graph in
    </li>
    <li>
     Name the graph to the name you want to refer to it by
    </li>
    <li>
     Create inputs like in an ordinary graph and wire up the function
    </li>
    <li>
     Create a node of the type subgraph_output and connect the result of the function to it
    </li>
    <li>
     Press the Export Subgraphs button in the toolbar
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    When doing this, the subgraphs in the document will be exported to the directories
    <code>
     &lt;Userdocs&gt;/Allegorithmic/Substance Designer/sdmatx/mtlx
    </code>
    and
    <code>
     &lt;Userdocs&gt;/Allegorithmic/Substance Designer/sdmatx/mdl
    </code>
    for the MaterialX definition
and mdl definitions respectively. Substance Designer doesn't allow reloading MDL defintions
so you need to restart designer when re-exporting a subgraph. The one exception to this
rule is if you are only interested in the MaterialX/GLSL version where you can skip the 
restart assuming:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The interface (inputs, parameters, outputs) has not changed
    </li>
    <li>
     It's a graph that was exported with the same interface before starting designer
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Advanced Notes
   </h2>
   <p>
    These are features that are not fully supported but mentioned here for advanced users
that are not afraid of experimenting with the Python scripts directly. Get in touch
with us in case you run into any issues doing these things and we'd be happy to help
out getting things right.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Importing own MaterialX libraries
   </h3>
   <p>
    If you have your own set of MaterialX nodes you want to use inside of the Designer 
MaterialX editor you need to make sure they are found by designer and properly converted
to MDL definitions. The MDL conversion is still limited and it only supports single
return value functions and a limited set of types.
The key things to get this right is:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Make sure the path is in the MaterialX search paths
     <code>
      sdmatxplugin/python/sdmatx/paths.py
     </code>
    </li>
    <li>
     Make sure it's listed as a module to build on startup
     <code>
      sdmatxplugin/__init__.py
     </code>
    </li>
    <li>
     You need to clean the preexisting mdl files in
     <code>
      sdmatxplugin/data/mdl/matx
     </code>
     except utilities.mdl (which is handwritten) to trigger a rebuilding the libraries next
time Designer is restarted.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>
    Adding support for Ubershaders
   </h3>
   <p>
    The MaterialX graph can support multiple ubershaders but at the moment the only 
properly implemented one is standard surface from Autodesk.
In order to add support for your own Ubershader you need to produce a GLSLFX template
and a GLSL root shader.
Let's say you are looking to create a shader with a node type called
    <code>
     my_shader
    </code>
    .
First it needs to be created as a shader in MaterialX and imported as described in the
previous topic so it's available from designer.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Designer
   </h4>
   <p>
    You need create the following files:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      sdmatxplugin/data/shaders/my_shader_template.glslfx
     </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      sdmatxplugin/data/shaders/my_shader/fs_modular.glsl
     </strong>
     (or whatever glsl file you reference from the template)
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    When the code generation hits the shader it will look up the template named
    <shader>
     _template
and add any exposed parameters to it.
    </shader>
   </p>
   <p>
    It will also generate a file caled
    <code>
     sdmatxplugin/data/shaders/my_shader/matx.glsl
    </code>
    which contains the entry point called
    <code>
     matx_compute
    </code>
    for generating all the 
inputs for the ubershader. Its interface is defined by the node def in MaterialX.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to use the generated function, include it in the fs_modular.glsl and call it
from the main function and use the generated values to drive your lighting calculations.
The best starting point is looking at the standard_surface implementation inside of
the plugin.
   </p>

   <h4>
    Painter
   </h4>
   <p>
    Substance Painter has a different way of implementing GLSL shaders and the mechanism is
putting a template file inside of
    <code>
     sdmatxplugin/data/painter/my_shader_template.glsl
    </code>
    In the painter case most of the code is generated for you including the outputs of the
procedural part of the shader. The contents of the template file will be glued in
for you in the generated shader. Your job is to use these values and drive the shading 
from this. The easiest way to get this right is looking at what happens with the 
standard_surface shader that comes with the plugin.

   <h3>
    Coordinate systems
   </h3>
   <p>
    Different applications and applications uses different coordinate systems.
For the provided material ball model as of 0.1.3, the object space should align
with the object space for the same model in Substance Designer.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Substance Designer
   </h4>
   <p>
    Substance Designer supports world and object space coordinates for positions/normals
The object space is the untransformed mesh as it is in the scene graph, the 
world is the transformed mesh
   </p>
   <h4>
    Substance Painter
   </h4>
   <p>
    Substance Painter has no notion of object space so it uses the same 
coordinate system for World and Object space and  it's what maps to the Designer 
world coordinate system.
   </p>
   <h4>
    MaterialX View
   </h4>
   <p>
    MaterialX view uses OBJ files which has no notion of transform. The Object space
is defined as the coordinate system in the mesh, world space is sometimes different
since the user can transform the object in various ways.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Recommendations
   </h4>
   <ul>
    <li>
     When authoring individual assets build your procedurals for object
space since it will make the procedural stable to transformations (i.e rotating
or translating the object will not affect the procedural).
    </li>
    <li>
     When working with different applications, use a mesh where you bake any 
transformations into the model before starting to work. This means it will come
out aligned in different applications. If you have a transformation hierarchy on
the model (and use a format supporting it) your object space will be misaligned
if previewing an OBJ export of it in the MaterialX Viewer or you import it in 
Painter
